How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Chrome's Devtools inspector is great because it allows you to see your css changes in action, as you make them. It is particularly helpful for formatting and positioning elements because you can view their movement in real time. You can resize elements by setting height and width attributes and changing the padding/border size.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static: not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties. Positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
Relative: positioned relative to its normal position. Top, right, bottom, and left property settings will adjust it away from its normal position. Other content will be adjusted to fill any gap left.
Fixed: positioned relative to the viewport. It always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. Top, right, bottom and left are used to position. Does not leave a gap in the page where it normally would be located.
Absolute: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or document body. It moves along with page scrolling.

I found using these to be somewhat confusing in general. I still don't have a really strong grasp on them and will need more practice.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin is the space outside the border of the element.
Border is the actual border size of the element.
Padding sets the size of the space between element content and the border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I feel somewhat neutral about this challenge.Things that seemed like they should be super simple ended being more complicated than I thought. Overall, I find positioning with css somewhat confusing at this time.
