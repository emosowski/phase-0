    <h2>Version control, git, and Github!</h2>
    <h4>January 23, 2016</h4>

      <p>
          This week I learned about version control, a version control program, git, and, a website, Github. Version control is enormously helpful in keeping track of changes as you work on various project both solo, and, collaboratively.

      <p>
          Git is a version control program that  allows for you to create save points or “commits" within your work that you can label and later return to, either for reference, or to begin again. This can be essential when collaborating with a team on a project as it gives your teammates the opportunity to review your changes prior to adding them to the master copy. It helps your team work simultaneously, while safeguarding against mistakes, and,  prevents you from stepping on other people’s toes.

      <p>
          Github is a website that serves as a hub for git repositories, making things even easier.  It streamlines your work further by showing you who changed what, when, and then allowing you to merge the changes, all within an easy to use graphical user interface. It saves time when collaborating because instead of sending the file back and forth, everything can be reviewed and merged on Github.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  <main>

    -item that makes sense on its own (good way to delineate something like blog posts)
  <section>
    -section of an article

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser reads HTML from top to bottom, so, the elements get laid out from top to bottom on the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how helpful Sublime can be. Snippets are going to become extremely useful ways to start with basic structure, and I definitely forsee creating many of them. I have already seen several other snippets that I can use such as one where it automatically enters 3 paragraph tags at a time.
