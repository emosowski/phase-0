# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about Time Boxing and the Fogg Method of Tiny Habits. Time Boxing is a set period of time in which a person works toward the completion of something. Instead of working until the full task is accomplished, work is done until the time limit is reached, and then progress is evaluated. While time constraints can vary greatly (such as the pomodoro technique or speed dating) , the consistent aspects of Time Boxing include stopping once the time limit has been reached, and then reflecting on the progress made.

Because of the remote nature of Phase 0, time boxing can be an incredible asset. While managing phase 0 work along with busy schedules, it will be extremely important to begin the week by mapping out how long I think each task will take. Then I can divide them into increments and set aside the appropriate time throughout the week. Most of us will not have consistent long periods of time to endlessly work on things, so, Time Boxing will encourage a set period that allows me to progress and then reflect on how my strategies are working and how I can learn more productively.  If I am stuck on a challenge, Time Boxing can help me avoid wasting too much time trying to solve something in one go. Instead I can work on it for the period, access where I am at, take a break, and then come back to it. This can similarly be applied to pair programming.

This exercise is the perfect example of time boxing because the instructions assert that one hour should be spent. If not for this time constraint, research into various techniques could go on for way too long. Learning to set my own time limits, and reflecting on the successes of these strategies will allow for my learning and productivity to reach their peaks.
I currently use Time-Boxing to manage my time, although, I did not know there was a name for it! This strategy has worked well for me so far. I have generally made my increment 1 hour long, however, I am curious to try out various time spans and see how they contribute to, or possibly hurt, my productivity.

I plan to continue to employ Time Boxing and I also think the idea of Tiny Habits from the Fogg Method will be helpful to me. For example, I will pick an existing habit such as taking out the trash. Then, after I take out the trash, I will rate the 8 pieces of feedback I need to do each week. I will celebrate completing the habit by patting myself on the back.

My overall plan for time management for phase 0 is to take a brief assessment of the tasks assigned each week and set aside time each day to work on them, as my work schedule changes daily. For longer tasks, I will break them down further into smaller increments of time using Time Boxing. I plan to employ the idea of tiny habits for skills I want to continuously practice.
# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell gives access to the capabilities of a computer using either the command line interface, or graphical user interface. Bash is a shell that uses the command line interface.

2. I think the most challenging thing was that the command line interface does not give you much visual representation of anything, so you must know the commands. GUI makes everything much feel much more intuitive.

3. I was able to successfully use everything except cp to copy the file from my desktop to my temp directory. I am still trying to figure that one out.

4. I think the most important commands to know are pwd to help you identify your path, cd to navigate to different directories, ls to see what is inside the directories, and grep to find things inside files. Oh, and, apropos (Help)!

5.

-pwd print working directory (prints the directory you are operating in)

-ls lists what is in the directory

-mv moves a directory or file

-cd changes a directory

-../ unsure

-touch unsure

-mkdir make directory

-less view parts of a file as pages

-rmdir remove directory

-rm remove file

-help tells you what a command does
# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repo, click the + symbol in the upper right hand corner of github and select "create new repository". To fork a repo, go to the repo you would like to fork, click the fork button in the upper right corner. Select the location you would like to fork the repo to. To clone a repo, locate the URL contained in the repo next to ("new file" and "find file") and copy it. Then, in terminal on your computer, navigate to the directory you would like this repo to be located. Once there, put git clone and paste the url. Hit enter.

I would fork a repository instead of creating a new one to retain the directories and files within the existing repository. If I created a new repository it would be empty, and I would not have what I need to access.

Setting up git and GitHub went pretty smoothly for me. The only issue I ran into was deleting a repository. I made sure my repository was empty and attempted to delete, but it still returned the directory not empty error. I am unsure of why this is.
