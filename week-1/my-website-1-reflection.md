1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

https://github.com/emosowski/emosowski.github.io

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on Github, go to your github profile and click the tab that says "Repositories". Once there, click the "New" button to create a new repository. Make sure your account name is listed under owner and then add a name for your repository. Add a description, decide whether it will be public or private, add a readme file, and add any licenses you may want. Click "create repository". Now copy the clone URL from the new repository page and go to your terminal. Use cd to get to the directory where you want the clone to go. Now enter git clone <paste url> and hit enter. It may prompt you for your github username and password. Now put ls to make sure it lists the cloned repository. Use cd <repo_name> to go into the master branch of the cloned repository. Use ls to check that you have all of the files inside the cloned repository. You can compare this to the list of files within the repository on your github account.

3. Describe what open source means.What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source gives you access to the code of a program, in addition to the version a computer can understand. this allows you to see how the program is put together, and make any changes that you want, to create your own version. Many companies do not open source their code so that they can keep control. Others decide to use open source because they benefit from the contributions of the community.

I think Open Source is pretty amazing. The opportunities it creates for so many to collaborate on programs allows for some really incredible progress on new programs, and improvements and updates on existing ones. At this time it does not make me feel nervous or protective, however, if I had a great idea for a program I believe I would feel quite secretive or possessive over it and would have to weigh the positives and negatives of making it open source. I will need to do more research regarding actual issues people have run into when using open source.

4. Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using a license can be important to allow you to open source your code, while still retaining some rights. It can help you avoid having to individually grant permission for each person that wants to use your code. This can allow you to let others use your code, but create some parameters for the use depending on which license you choose. There are several different types of license that vary in how they structure the open source use of code.

5. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The concept of creating branches of repositories was solidified in this challenge. When to create a branch really confused me, but, I have a much better understanding now. I also got a better grasp on the difference between repositories, branches, directories and files, and how to navigate each of them within the command line. I struggled to execute many of the git commands without referencing the various resources, but going through this challenge further solidified the prompts and steps in my mind.
